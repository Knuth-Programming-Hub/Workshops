**Date**: February 1, 2021 <br>
**Conducted By**: [Utkarsh](https://github.com/utkarsh261), [Rishik](https://github.com/sosooding) and [Hemant](https://github.com/hemant2132)

### Agenda

- **What is a Graph?**

  - Real-life examples and applications
  - Directed and undirected graphs
  - Weighted and unweighted graphs

- **Common Terminologies**

  - Nodes and Edges
  - Paths and Shortest Paths
  - Components
  - Levels and Neighbours

- **Graph Representation**

  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Adjacency List and its importance in contests

- **Trees**

  - Properties
    1.  No Cycles
    2.  Unique Path between any pair of nodes
    3.  Connected graph
    4.  N-1 edges, if there are N nodes
  - Importance of Trees

- **Graph Traversals**

  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
  - Visualisation + Code
