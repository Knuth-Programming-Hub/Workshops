**Date**: 1st of February 2021

**Conducted By**: [Utkarsh](https://github.com/utkarsh261), [Rishik](https://github.com/sosooding) and [Hemant](https://github.com/hemant2132)

## Agenda:
1.  What is a Graph and its types:
   - Real-life examples and applications
   - Directed and undirected graphs
   - Weighted and unweighted graphs
2. Common Terminology:
   - Node and Edges
   - Path and Shortest Path
   - Components
   - Levels and Neighbours
3. Graph Representation:
   - Adjacency Matrix
   - Adjacency List and its importance in contests
4. Trees and their importance:
   - Properties:
      1. No Cycles
      2. Unique Path between any pair of nodes.
      3. Connected graph
      4. N-1 edges if there are N nodes.
   - Importance of Trees
5. Graph Traversals:
   - BFS: Visualisation and Code
   - DFS: Visualisation and Code
